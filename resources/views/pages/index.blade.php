                The work of a team should always embrace a great player but the great
                player must always work. '<br> “Very often our victories were squeaked
                 out in the last few minutes after we had drained the life from our opponents.
                Games – like life – are all about waiting for chances and then pouncing on them.<br>
                The way to win battles, wars and games is by attacking
                 and overrunning the opposing side. <br>

                I always had a philosophy which I got from my father. He used to say, 'Listen.
                   God gave to you the gift to play football. This is your gift from God.
                   If you take care of your health, if you are in good shape all the time,
                   with your gift from God no one will stop you,
                   but you must be prepared.'<br>
